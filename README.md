# Project Discontinued
 
  Hi all.

  As of the 24st of June 2018, Grimoire has been discontinued.
  I no longer have the time or funds to keep maintaining this project.
      
  In case you are looking for an alternative, I can fully recommend switching to <a href="https://github.com/bra1n">bra1n's</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bra1n/judgebot">JudgeBot</a>.
  It covers most of the functionality Grimoire used to provide, and more.

  Many thanks to all the people who supported me and this project, with special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/LightRodAU">@LightRod</a> for putting up with my many mtg related questions.
